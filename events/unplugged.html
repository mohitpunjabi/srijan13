Tired of the hosh-posh of pedals and distortions the vintage sound of an acoustic guitar is what you dig or the classical tabla,then this event is for you. The origins of unplugged are rooted in the flagship MTV event by the same name where the stars played their signature pieces on acoustic instruments while interacting with In house audiences.
So this Srijan let the unadulterated music sweep you off your feet and keep you humming for Days on End.<br />
<br />
Full event details will be available soon.
