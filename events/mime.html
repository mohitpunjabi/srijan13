	Come forward and speak but this time  don't pull up your vocal chords ;  time is to fire your gestures to burn the world with ideas. Before the human voice was there, gestures served not only to communicate but to aid in the development of vocal sounds. Just like they say: ACTIONS certainly speak louder than WORDS! MIME requires participants to portray a play, pertaining to a theme. Prize Worth 20000/-<br />

	Full event details will be available soon.
